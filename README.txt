CS3372 - Programming Assignment 3

In this assignment you will develop a program that will calculate subnet information based on specific
inputs using python:
1 The program will ask for the following information:
    a. IPv4 Address in decimal form (i.e. 192.168.1.124)
    b. Mask bits, 1 - 32
2 The program will compute and display the following information:
    a. Subnet or Network ID (first IP address in the network range)
    b. Broadcast Address (last IP in the network range)
    c. Subnet Mask in decimal form (i.e. 255.255.255.192)
    d. Maximum number of hosts allowed in the network
3 The program will exit after the results have been displayed.

The only module that you should import anything from is sys. Using more than this will cause you to
fail.
